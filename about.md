I am a 20 year old data scientist currently living in San Francisco. I recently graduated Metis, an intense immersive data science bootcamp. I am passionate about artificial intelligence/machine learning methods, and their applications to make the world a better place. I have a paticular interest in alternative education methods that enable people to self-learn more efficiently. My experience spans from quantitative trading in financial markets to dynamically reducing the complexity of high-level research papers. I love to help people, so  if you have any questions feel free to reach out to me.
